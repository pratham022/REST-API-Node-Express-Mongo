# REST-API-Node-Express-Mongo
A CRUD App using Node, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose. I referred [Telusko channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYVGoXPq2RA) for implementing this api.

### Steps to run this project
```
git clone https://github.com/pratham022/REST-API-Node-Express-Mongo.git
cd REST-API-Node-Express-Mongo
npm install
```

- `npm install` will install dependencies like express, mongodb and mongoose.
- We can use nodemon which restarts the node application automatically when file changes in the directory are detected.
- Run `npm install nodemon --save-dev` to install nodemon.
- Also make sure to start mongodb server in your local machine.

### Run with nodemon
```
npm run start
```
